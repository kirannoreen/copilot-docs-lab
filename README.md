## How the GC content function works
The GC content function calculates the percentage of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases in a given DNA sequence. It takes a string input representing the DNA sequence, counts the occurrences of G and C, and divides that by the total length of the sequence to get the GC content percentage.
## How to run
To run the GC content function, you can use the following steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the code file containing the GC content function.
3. Call the function with a DNA sequence string as an argument.
4. Print or return the result to see the GC content percentage.
